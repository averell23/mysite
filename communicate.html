<FONT FACE="Arial">Communicate!</FONT></H2></CENTER>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Little has changed since I put this page up, and I decided
to put things into order, and maybe to find out what this page is all about.&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial">The ability to communicate, by itself, is a social
skill and I can hardly tell you how to do it. (Especially since I'm still
working on that skills myself)&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, the net does - as the telephone did before
- enhance our possibilities to communicate. We can now send messages to
the most remote places for a small charge, and we can come in contact with
people we'd never had heard of otherwise.&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial">Exchanging letters has become faster, cheaper and
easier than ever before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial">But maybe it has also become less intimate, more
anonymous and impersonal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial">Also, the use of the current means of communication
will be newly defined. Recieving a handwritten letter has a different meaning
when your other correspondence consists only of hastily typed email messages.&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The "Internet Hype" the world is experiencing at
the moment has little to do with the medium itself. The net is but a tool
like many others.&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial">But it is a new tool, and we're still trying to
find out how to use it. We are fascinated by the unknown that lies in front
of us, and maybe afraid of what it may become in the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We are walking this still unexplored world, gathering
bricks of information, turning them, curious like children, exchanging
them and wondering how they'll fit toghether to build a new kind of building.&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We need to remember that the boundaries are not out
there: They are in our mind.&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We will face dangers on the way: People will try
to steal our information, unwise governments, companies and others will
try to walk our private places without our consent. Others will try to
erect places of hate and hostility.&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is our duty to regulate this world wisely, to
allow it's inhabitants to enjoy their freedoms, and ensure that their freedoms
cannot be taken away.&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This page will be an reflection of how different
people define communication within this new medium. I will link to places
where new ideas are discussed, and new things are tried, as well as to
places where people have surrendered their curiosity to their fear.&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial">I will add some of my own thoughts, when I find
the time.&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This selection makes no distinction between "good"
or "bad". It merely offers you some starting points to roam this new world
and find out what it could become.&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Reach me</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT COLOR="#000000">If you want to communicate,
you can send me an email to unp2@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de, or you can still
send me s-mail and call me on the phone. (However, you will still have
to send me email first).</FONT></FONT>
