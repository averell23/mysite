undergoing a major redesign, and there will certainly be much more interesting
stuff later. However, since I'm notoriously lazy and/or overwerworked,
that may take a while. But make sure to check in again!</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I want this pages to be attractive and simple, so
I've gone back to the roots. No more frames, sound, fancy backgrounds or
whatever at the moment, sorry.</FONT>

the world. I will put up things that I find interesting, funny, wise or
provocative. This pages will reflect my thoughts and opinions, my experience
and my prejudices.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Enjoy!</FONT>
